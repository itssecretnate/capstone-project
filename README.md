# Project Description:
My project will be a website for me and my movie loving girlfriend. The website will have a database that contains a list of movies that we would like to see together. This will include tracking the dates we watch the movies and our personal ratings of the movies we see.

### Features:
1. Add and remove movies to a database. (Keeps track of what we want to watch)
2. Randomly pick a movie for us to watch.

   - See if a movie is currently in theaters and display showtimes.
   - Show what services a movie is avaiable to watch on.
   - Countdown to movies coming out in theaters.
